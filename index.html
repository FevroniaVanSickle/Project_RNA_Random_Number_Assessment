                For the next two minutes, you will be asked to complete a task in which you will
                enter a random number (between 1 and 9) at every one-second interval. You should try
                to be as random as possible. Picking random numbers can be thought of in terms of
                picking numbers out of a hat, returning it, shaking the hat’s contents, and then
                picking another number out of the hat. Doing this may sometimes, although not
                typically, result in the same number occurring two or more times in a row
                (e.g., 2, 2, 2). For this task you will be asked to enter a series of random numbers
                from 1 to 9. Once you press START TASK, you will hear a soft beep (turn volume up)
                and you will have a box to enter a number from 1 to 9. As soon as you enter one number,
                another beep will sound and a new box will appear. You will keep doing this task for a
                couple of minutes. Try and be as random as possible with your number entries.
                You will have just one second to enter each number, so have your fingers on the number
                keys and be ready to go before you press start! If you fail to enter a number within
                1 second, you will receive a warning, “too slow!” If this happens, just continue to
                do your best to enter numbers each second. The green bar at the bottom will indicate
                how much longer you have left in the task.

                    For this next task, you will be presented with 3 “cue words.” Your task is to
                    determine a single word that is commonly associated with all three cue words.
                    You will have 15 seconds to solve each problem. For example, if given the cue
                    words: carpet, alert, and ink. What would be the correct response? Red. As a second
                    example, if given the cue words: cane, daddy, and plum. What would be the correct
                    response? Sugar.
